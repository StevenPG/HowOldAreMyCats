# New Cat Site

Replace the existing cat-site with this react implementation.
Once this is complete, override the cat-site folder, and then
do a production build and remove base files to perform the "deployment".

### TODO

- Recreate site entirely
- use typescript everywhere
- better instagram embed/integration
- have some small section done in WASM as sample
  - Do all the math in server-side WASM
- do everything as REACT-ey as possible
- Update Documentation
  - https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/project-structure
  - Stick to next.js project structure
